Description: The Human Cell Atlas provides RNAseq and other data from
    high-throughput single cell genomics experiments. This package
    provides case studies showing how the data can be accessed using
    the 'hca' package. The emphasis is on discovering sample and
    experiment metadata, and on constructing the count matrix of gene
    x cell expression values, with the goal of creating a Bioconductor
    SingleCellExperiment object for use the workflows described in the
    online resource 'Orchestrating Single Cell Analysis with
    Bioconductor' (https://bioconductor.org/books/OSCA).
